Radar System using Arduino, Servo Motor, and Ultrasonic Sensor
This project implements a mini radar system that detects obstacles and displays their position within a certain range. An ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a servo motor, which continuously rotates to scan the surroundings. The Arduino microcontroller controls the servo movement and reads distance data from the ultrasonic sensor. The collected data is then processed and displayed on a computer screen in a radar-like interface, showing real-time detection of objects.

Key features:

Uses ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) for distance measurement.

Servo motor provides rotational scanning for 180Â° coverage.

Arduino acts as the control unit for sensor data acquisition and motor control.

Provides a radar-style visualization to monitor object position and distance.

Applications:

Obstacle detection and avoidance systems.

Security and surveillance.

Robotics and autonomous navigation.
